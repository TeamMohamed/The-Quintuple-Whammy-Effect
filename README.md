The Quintuple Whammy Effect – Therapeutic Framework for Multi-Domain Gene Editing, Epigenetic Reprogramming, and Quantum Modulation

Overview
This repository contains the full licensing-ready White Paper and Pitch Deck for the Quintuple Whammy Effect therapeutic framework.

The Quintuple Whammy system integrates:
- Five bioactive therapeutic domains (Monoterpenes, Sesquiterpenes, Polyphenols, Medicinal Mushrooms, Algae/Spices)
- Precision gene editing via CRISPR-Cas systems and miRNA modulation
- Quantum biocomputing for guide RNA optimization and off-target minimization

The framework delivers a next-generation strategy for:
- DNA repair and genomic stability
- Epigenetic reprogramming and tumor suppressor reactivation
- Neuroimmune recalibration and synaptic plasticity
- Redox balance and mitochondrial biogenesis
- Quantum-enhanced therapeutic precision
